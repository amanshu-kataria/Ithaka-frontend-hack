## Details
This project is split into 5 major components, namely the `NavBar`, `LeftPanel`, `CenterPanel`, `PlanCard` and `CreatePlan`. We expect the candidate to create atleast these 5 components in your React Application.

The `body` tag should have these specific details:
- Color: #333
- Font: Open Sans (Google Font)
- Font Size: 13px

The application should not break on any laptop/desktop screen resolution. Mobile devices support is not required. You can use any CSS framework (ex. Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation).

### NavBar
The Navbar should be of the following constrains
- Height: 50px
- Background: #efefef

### LeftPanel
- Width: 1/4th of the screen.
- Background: #eee.

### CenterPanel
- Width: 3/4th of the screen.
- Background: #fff.

### PlanCard
- Height: 200px.

The rest of the design can be as you see fit.

### CreatePlan
The complete design of the `CreatePlan` form can be as per you. Think, research and use the best user interface suitable for this problem. We will be gauging your ability to think from the user's perspective in this component.
